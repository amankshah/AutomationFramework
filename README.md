# Automated Testing Framework for Web Applications

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive automation framework designed to test any web application or website efficiently. The framework integrates various modern technologies and tools to ensure robust, scalable, and maintainable test automation.

## Key Technologies and Tools
- **Unit Testing Framework:** JUnit
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):** Cucumber
- **Web Framework:** Spring Boot
- **Build and Dependency Management:** Maven
- **Browser Automation:** Selenium WebDriver
- **Driver Management:** WebDriverManager
- **Gherkin Language:** For writing feature files
- **Version Control:** GitHub and GitLab
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** GitLab CI/CD
- **Logging:** Log4j
- **Containerization:** Docker

## Framework Structure

### Project Setup
- **Maven Project:** The project is set up as a Maven project to manage dependencies and build lifecycle efficiently. 
- **Spring Boot Integration:** Spring Boot is used to create a robust and scalable application context for the automation framework.

### Test Design
- **Unit Testing:** JUnit is used for unit tests, ensuring that individual components of the application work as expected.
- **BDD with Cucumber:** Tests are written in Gherkin syntax, making them readable and allowing collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders. Cucumber is used to execute these BDD tests.

### Test Execution
- **Selenium WebDriver:** For browser automation, Selenium WebDriver is employed to interact with web elements and perform actions like clicks, form submissions, and validations.
- **WebDriverManager:** Automatically manages browser driver binaries required by Selenium WebDriver, eliminating the need for manual setup.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
- **GitLab CI/CD:** Integrated with GitLab CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. Ensures that tests are run on every commit, providing immediate feedback on code changes.

### Logging and Reporting
- **Log4j:** Incorporated for logging purposes, capturing detailed logs of test executions, which are essential for debugging and analyzing test runs.
- **Reports:** Generates comprehensive test reports, providing insights into test results, failures, and overall test coverage.

### Containerization
- **Docker:** Utilized for containerizing the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying the deployment process.

## Framework Components

### Test Suite Structure
- `src/main/java`: Contains application logic if any required for the framework.
- `src/test/java`: Contains test classes and step definitions for Cucumber.
- `src/test/resources`: Houses feature files written in Gherkin syntax and configuration files.

### Configuration Files
- `pom.xml`: Maven configuration file for managing dependencies.
- `application.properties`: Spring Boot configuration file for setting application properties.
- `log4j.properties`: Configuration file for Log4j logging.

### Sample Feature File (Gherkin Syntax)
```gherkin
Feature: Login functionality

Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
  Given the user is on the login page
  When the user enters valid credentials
  And clicks on the login button
  Then the user should be redirected to the homepage
```
### Conclusion
This automation framework is designed to be flexible, scalable, and easy to maintain. By integrating various tools and technologies, it ensures efficient test automation for any web application, providing quick feedback on code quality and stability. The use of BDD with Cucumber enhances collaboration, while the CI/CD integration ensures smooth and continuous delivery of high-quality software.
